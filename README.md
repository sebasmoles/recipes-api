# Recipes API

- A simple mock API that retrieves recipes you can interact with.
- It was built using [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) fake REST API, and deployed using [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/platform).

## Quick Guide

- Go to https://recipes-api-project.herokuapp.com/recipes to check all the current recipes, as well as the due JSON format. 
- You can make any type of requests to that URL (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). See [json-server documentation](https://github.com/typicode/json-server#getting-started) for more information about how to make requests.

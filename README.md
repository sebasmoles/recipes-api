# Recipes API

- A simple mock API that provides recipes you can interact with.
- It was built using [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) fake REST API.

## Quick Guide

- Go to https://recipes-api-project.herokuapp.com/recipes, to see all the current recipes. 
- You can make any type of requests to that URL (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- If you want to add a new recipe, make sure to follow the same JSON format of the other recipes.
- See [json-server documentation](https://github.com/typicode/json-server#getting-started) for more information about how to make requests.
